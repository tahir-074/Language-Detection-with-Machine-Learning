- Language detection is a task in natural language processing that involves identifying the language of a given text or document.
- Machine learning models have been successfully applied to language identification, thanks to the availability of large language datasets.
- Google Translate is a popular language translator that utilizes a machine learning model for language detection.
- Training a language detection model requires a significant amount of data for each language to achieve accurate real-time performance.
- The dataset used for training the language detection model in this case is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 1000 sentences for each of the 22 popular languages.
- Python can be used to train a language detection model with machine learning, and the subsequent steps will be explained in the following section.
